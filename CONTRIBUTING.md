## Bug reports and enhancement requests
Bug reports and enhancement requests are an important part of making ImportExcel more stable and are curated though Github issues. When reporting an issue or request, please select the [appropriate category and fill out the issue form](https://github.com/dfinke/ImportExcel/issues) fully to ensure others and the core development team can fully understand the scope of the issue.

The issue will then show up to the ImportExcel community and be open to comments/ideas from others.

## Finding an issue to contribute to
If you are brand new to ImportExcel or open-source development, we recommend searching the [GitHub “issues” tab] (https://github.com/dfinke/ImportExcel/issues) to find issues that interest you. Unassigned issues labeled `Docs` and `good first issue` are typically good for newer contributors.

## Tips for a successful pull request
Contributions are reviewed by a small number of people, which can lead to delays in getting your pull request reviewed.
The following are some tips to increase of the chances of your pull request getting approved:
 - Reference an open issue for non-trivial changes to clarify the PR’s purpose.
 - Ensure you have appropriate tests. These should be the first part of any PR.
 - Keep your pull requests as simple as possible. Larger PRs take longer to review.
 - Ensure that CI is in a green state. Reviewers may not even look otherwise.
 - Keep Updating your pull request, either by request or every few days.
